Author: <https://www.youtube.com/@_JohnHammond>

> Ohhhh, Tab, Tab, Tab.... what has she done. My friend Tabby just got a new laptop and she's been using it to take notes. She says she puts her whole life on there! She was so excited to finally have a date with a boy she liked, but she completely forgot the details of where and when. She told me she remembers writing it in a note... but she doesn't think she saved it!! She shared with us an export of her laptop files.
