# Math as a Service

## Description

The author of [this library](https://github.com/silentmatt/expr-eval) forgot to push a security fix to the [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expr-eval). No worries though, I manually installed the latest version to ensure my service is as secure as possible!

Build / deploy: `docker run -p 5000:5000 --privileged $(docker build -q .)`
